High-level description:
Want to hard-code a map into a .mat file so that when we design a program
for task 3, we can simply load the .mat file from file.
This script will generate a file called map.mat for this purpose.
At this point, I think it will use the pic Barbara took to generate the
map.

photo = imread('arena.jpg');
